Cervical Cancer Cell Classification Project
An automatic screening and classification system for cervical cancer cells using deep learning techniques is developed.
The ResNet-50 architecture is a powerful convolutional neural network that has shown excellent performance in image classification tasks.
An interactive UI is developed to choose among three CNN architectures and perform the classification on the browed image from your local folder.
 
DATASET
The SIPaKMED dataset is a publicly available dataset that consists of cervical images. 4049 isolated cells images are manually cropped to obtain 966 cluster images.
The dataset has five types of cancer cells and it is class balanced.

To run this project, the following dependencies need to be installed:
Python 3 (version 3.6 or later)
TensorFlow (version 2.0 or later)
Keras (version 2.0 or later)
NumPy
Matplotlib
PIL
gradio
opencv-python

HOW TO RUN
The dataset can be loaded from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/prahladmehandiratta/cervical-cancer-largest-dataset-sipakmed .
Run the file DLSIP RESNET50 91.ipynb for performing the classification of cervical cancer cells. The trained model is stored as an .h5 file.
Run the file GUI_CervicalCancerCellClassification.ipynb which makes use of image_classifier.py file to classify and test the image with the saved model.
