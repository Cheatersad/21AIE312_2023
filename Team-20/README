ABOUT PROJECT
An automatic screening and classification system for cervical cancer cells using deep learning techniques is developed. 
ResNet-50 is used to conduct cervical cancer screening and apply Deep Learning classification techniques to the SIPAKMED pap-smear image dataset.

DATASET
The SIPaKMED dataset is a publicly available dataset that consists of cervical images. 4049 isolated cells images are manually cropped to obtain 966 cluster images. 

HOW TO RUN
Run the file DLSIP RESNET50 91.ipynb for performing the classification of cervical cancer cells. The trained model is stored as an h5 file.
