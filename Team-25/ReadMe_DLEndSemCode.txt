This ReadMe file for the DL EndSem Project code for Team 25 provides the code snippet and its' subsequent explanation:

#1.CODE:
#1. bringing in the YOLOv5 model to the environment where code is running
!git clone https://github.com/spacewalk01/Yolov5-Fire-Detection
%cd Yolov5-Fire-Detection

# Install yolov5
!git clone https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5
%cd yolov5
!pip install -r requirements.txt

EXPLANATION:
This code performs the following actions:
!git clone https://github.com/spacewalk01/Yolov5-Fire-Detection: This line clones a GitHub repository called "Yolov5-Fire-Detection" to the current directory. This repository likely contains code related to fire detection using the YOLOv5 object detection framework.
%cd Yolov5-Fire-Detection: This line changes the current working directory to the "Yolov5-Fire-Detection" directory that was cloned in the previous step.
!git clone https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5: This line clones another GitHub repository called "yolov5". This repository contains the official implementation of the YOLOv5 object detection model.
%cd yolov5: This line changes the current working directory to the "yolov5" directory that was cloned in the previous step.
!pip install -r requirements.txt: This line installs the Python dependencies specified in the "requirements.txt" file. These dependencies are necessary to run the YOLOv5 model and related code.
In summary, this code sets up the necessary environment for running fire detection using the YOLOv5 model by cloning two GitHub repositories and installing the required dependencies.

#2.CODE:
!unzip "/content/gdrive/My Drive"/fire.zip
!unzip "/content/gdrive/My Drive"/fire.zip -d /content/Yolov5-Fire-Detection/datasets

EXPLANATION:
for this code and all the following code snippets, which are labelled #2.,these code snippets are for opening ther creator's google drive account,
where the fire.zip folder is stored for the creator of this code,and unzipping it from there.
these code blocks labelled #2. need not be used when you, the end user, are running this code in your syste after directly uploading the fire.zip folder
in the running environment and unzip it.
In the last two lines,"!unzip "/content/gdrive/My Drive"/fire.zip", and,
"!unzip "/content/gdrive/My Drive"/fire.zip -d /content/Yolov5-Fire-Detection/datasets", the text '/content/gdrive/My Drive' can be replaced with the path of
#where your fire.zip folder is saved.

#3. CODE:
#3. training the DL model
!python train.py --img 640 --batch 16 --epochs 3 --data ../fire_config.yaml --weights yolov5s.pt --workers 1

EXPLANATION:
This code is a command line instruction to train a DL (Deep Learning) model using a script called "train.py". Let's break down the command and its arguments:
!python train.py: This command runs the Python script "train.py" using the Python interpreter.
--img 640: This argument sets the input image size for training to 640x640 pixels. It means that during training, the images will be resized to a resolution of 640x640 pixels.
--batch 16: This argument sets the batch size for training to 16. The batch size determines how many images are processed together in each training iteration. In this case, 16 images will be used to update the model's parameters in one training step.
--epochs 3: This argument sets the number of training epochs to 3. An epoch represents a complete iteration through the entire training dataset. So, the model will be trained on the dataset three times.
--data ../fire_config.yaml: This argument specifies the path to a configuration file named "fire_config.yaml". This file contains information about the dataset, including the paths to the training and validation data, the number of classes, and other necessary settings.
--weights yolov5s.pt: This argument specifies the path to pre-trained weights file named "yolov5s.pt". Pre-trained weights are previously learned parameters that serve as an initial starting point for the training process. In this case, the model will use the pre-trained weights stored in "yolov5s.pt".
--workers 1: This argument sets the number of data loading workers to 1. Data loading workers are responsible for loading and preprocessing the training data. Here, only one worker will be used.
In summary, this code initiates the training of a DL model using the specified settings. It defines the input image size, batch size, number of epochs, dataset configuration file, pre-trained weights, and the number of data loading workers. Running this command will execute the training script and begin the training process for the DL model.

#4. CODE:
#4. Testing the model
!python detect.py --source ../input.mp4 --weights runs/train/exp/weights/best.pt --conf 0.2

EXPLANATION:
The code is a command line instruction to test a DL (Deep Learning) model using a script called "detect.py". Let's break down the command and its arguments:
!python detect.py: This command runs the Python script "detect.py" using the Python interpreter.
--source ../input.mp4: This argument specifies the source of the input data for testing. In this case, it is set to "../input.mp4", indicating that the script will process a video file named "input.mp4" located in the parent directory.
--weights runs/train/exp/weights/best.pt: This argument specifies the path to the weights file of the trained model. It points to "best.pt" file located in the "weights" folder inside the "runs/train/exp" directory.
--conf 0.2: This argument sets the confidence threshold for object detection to 0.2. It means that only detections with a confidence score higher than or equal to 0.2 will be considered valid.
In summary, this code initiates the testing of a DL model using the specified settings. It defines the source of the input data (in this case, a video file), the path to the trained model's weights file, and the confidence threshold for object detection. Running this command will execute the testing script and perform object detection on the specified video file using the trained model.

#5. CODE:
#5. Plotting the Results
from utils.plots import plot_results
plot_results('runs/train/exp/results.csv')

EXPLANATION:
code is used to plot the results from a CSV file using a function called plot_results() from a module called utils.plots. Let's break down the code line by line:
from utils.plots import plot_results: This line imports the plot_results() function from the utils.plots module. The utils.plots module likely contains utility functions for plotting results.
plot_results('runs/train/exp/results.csv'): This line calls the plot_results() function and passes the path to a CSV file as an argument. The CSV file, named "results.csv", is located in the "runs/train/exp" directory.
In summary, the code uses a plotting function to generate visual representations of the results stored in the "results.csv" file. The specific details of what is plotted and how it is visualized depend on the implementation of the plot_results() function in the utils.plots module.

#6. CODE:
#6. Validating our model
!python detect.py --weights runs/train/exp/weights/best.pt --img 640 --conf 0.25 --source ../datasets/fire/val/images/

EXPLANATION:
The provided code is a command-line instruction that runs a Python script called detect.py with specific arguments. Here's a breakdown of what the code does:
!python detect.py: Executes the Python script detect.py using the Python interpreter. The exclamation mark ! is often used in Jupyter notebooks or Colab to run shell commands within the notebook environment.
--weights runs/train/exp/weights/best.pt: Specifies the path to the weights file that will be used for the detection model. In this case, the file is located at runs/train/exp/weights/best.pt.
--img 640: Sets the input image size for the detection model to 640x640 pixels. This argument determines the resolution at which the images will be processed by the model.
--conf 0.25: Sets the confidence threshold for object detection. Objects with detection confidence below 0.25 will be filtered out. Adjusting this value can impact the number of detected objects and the trade-off between precision and recall.
--source ../datasets/fire/val/images/: Specifies the path to the source directory containing the images to be processed by the detection model. In this case, the images are located in the directory ../datasets/fire/val/images/.
Overall, this command is used to validate the performance of a trained object detection model by running it on a set of images. The model's weights are loaded, and the specified images are processed with object detection using the given arguments.
